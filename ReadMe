Rewards Program API 
This Spring Boot application provides a RESTful API to calculate and retrieve reward points earned by customers based on their purchases over a three-month period. The reward calculation is as follows:

Reward Points Logic:

2 points are awarded for every dollar spent over $100 in a single transaction.
1 point is awarded for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in a single transaction.
Example: A transaction of $120 earns 90 points (2 × $20 + 1 × $50).
Features:

Calculates monthly reward points for each customer based on their transactions.
Computes the total reward points earned over the three-month period.
Includes a REST endpoint to retrieve the reward details for a specific customer.
